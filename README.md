# Astro 497 Lab 5

## Exercise 1:  Model Building III:  Bayesian Inference & Probabilistic Programming Languages
- Work through ex1.jl  (a Pluto notebook)
- Work through ex2.jl  (a Pluto notebook)

## Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Characterize the mass and orbit of an exoplanet using radial velocity observations
- Build a Bayesian model for astronomical observations
- Specify a prior and likelihood using a probabilistic programming language

Students will strengthen their understanding of:
- Assessing models
