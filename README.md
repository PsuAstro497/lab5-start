# Astro 497 Lab 5

## Exercise 1:  Model Building III:  Bayesian Inference & Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs)
- Work through ex1.jl (a Pluto notebook) on fitting transit timing variations using a PPL
- Work through ex2.jl (a Pluto notebook) on fitting radial velocity observations using a PPL

## Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Characterize the mass and orbit of an exoplanet using radial velocity observations
- Build a Bayesian model for astronomical observations
- Specify a prior and likelihood using a probabilistic programming language
- Perform posterior sampling 
- Qualitatively evaluate the convergence of Markov chains
- Characterize the mass and orbit of an exoplanet using radial velocity observations
- Use an approximate model to assist with global search over a multi-modal parameter space
- Assess the sensitivity of inferential results to the choice of prior & likelihood

Students will strengthen their understanding of:
- Assessing models
- Evaluating the sensitivity of results to choice of priors and likelihood.
- Evaluating the effects of model misspecification
